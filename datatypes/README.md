Navigating the source
=====================

#### include
  Here lies all of the header files. These
  are automatically available to you. You
  will find all of the programming interfaces
  that you need here. Whether you are implementing
  them or just using them.

  If you are implementing them you should not
  need to change them.

#### src
  The implementation and other tools lie here.
  Inside you have:

  1. `lib` where you'll find a prepared implementation.
     Or you can put your own in here if you are implementing
     it yourself.
  2. `test` where you can find the google test test cases.
  3. `bin` where you will find some helpful programs to get
      you started.
